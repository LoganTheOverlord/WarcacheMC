# Seriously, you don't need plugins for this:

# Mob spawning:
Prevent mob spawning entirely: /gamerule doMobSpawning false

# Leaves decay in lobby, as well as growth of crops, etc.
Type in /gamerule randomTickSpeed 0
Note that this will also cancel crops and trees, bamboo, sugar cane etc.

# Freeze time
Type in /gamerule doDaylightCycle false

# Freeze Weather
Type in /gamerule doWeatherCycle false

# Prevent griefing from creepers
Type in /gamerule entityGriefing false
Note that this will not disable TNT's.
