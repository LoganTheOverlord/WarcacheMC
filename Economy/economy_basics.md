# Why use economy?
Economy allows you to add another trading layer for your server. For example - server shops, player shops, player professions, etc. We will talk about these!

# How to setup an economy?
First of all, download Vault:
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/
Then, download economy plugin of your choice. For our purposes, we use EssentialsX economy (https://essentialsx.net/)
After you have these two running, economy is done setting up!

# Adding shops
Essentials has in-built shop capabilities. You will have to enable sign commands ([Sell] [Buy] [Warp], etc).
