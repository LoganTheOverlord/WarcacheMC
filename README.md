# WarcacheMC

Why is Warcache interested in Minecraft development?
- We want to contribute to wellbeing of every modern Minecraft server, and modpack.
- Thus, we provide configurations, which will extend your abilities to have greater performance, more players, less CPU and RAM usage, etc.
- We are also interested in modpacks! (See Project: Immersion)
- We learn a lot of new things in process. And what else would we want? <3

# Why is this important?

We believe that if we share our knowledge, we give more people more opportunities to not only create better servers, but mainly hope to educate people in their way for quality servers. It's easy to set-up server, however, quality content is usually hidden behind years of work.
With this, we hope to share the best of our knowledge to make servers great again.
